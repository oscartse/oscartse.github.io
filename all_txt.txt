Portfolio
- Flipside Crypto, Terra Name Service
Evaluates the performance of TNS NFTs (Domain name) sales and corresponding revenue generated, protocol growth and user behaviour analysis.</p>
Flipside Crypto provides ready-to-use SQL query engine to perform fast and easy analysis. By querying TNS's contract address, having all the transactions info, with respective users'/buyers' namestring with domain names, documented at specific timestamps along with $x amount of crypto.
Terra Name Service is still prototyping in a very early stage. However, during the time of writing this analysis, the team had completed several milestones in the meantime - Reverse Record setting, integration with several wallets (Terra Station, XDEFI, Leap), and most importantly the buyback mechanism of $TNS Token.

- Semi real-time Hong Kong Public Traffic Dash
Data pipeline practice. Calling the Gov OpenData API for weather, traffic and event information, then sending back to python dash app to do visualization.
No insights. This is just a typical data pipeline exercise with semi-real-time call on API being processed to dashboard.

- Flipside Crypto, Terra Ecosystem Tracking
Terra is a fast-growing ecosystem on the ride of its decentralized algo-stablecoin - $ust, and its native chain token $luna. This dashboard hopefully brings insights on how quantifying metrics measures whether the ecosystem is expanding in a healthy way.
To quantify the healthiness of Terra Eco, there are three critical aspects to evaluate: 1) Anchor Dominance 2) Bridged Liquidity 3) Burn/mint activity on $ust

- Kedro eComm data Pipeline
As the pandemic continues, demand of delivery services on food and goods are staying sky high, how customers optimize their bucket items to maximize multiple discounts provided to reach the delivery minimum amount is critical to keep down per purchase cost.
Scraping item information like categories, SKU, price, availability, delivery status from HKTV mall, automating pipeline to periodically fetch them into machine learning models, evaluating recommender to best optimize the cost and maximize discount used.
Pretty decent to fetch data into web-based API then return a best combination of food items based on inputted recipes (like recipe recommendations based on refrigerator items).
