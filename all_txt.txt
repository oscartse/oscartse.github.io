- Flipside Crypto, Terra Name Service
Evaluate the performance of TNS NFTs (Domain name) sales and corresponding revenue generated, protocol growth and user behaviour analysis.</p>
Flipside Crypto provides ready-to-use SQL query engine to perform fast and easy analysis. By querying TNS's contract address, having all the transactions info on who bought which namestring of domain names at particular timestamp with $x amount of crypto.
Terra Name Service is still in a very early stage. At the time of writing this analysis, the team has already completed several milestones - Reverse Record setting, integration with several wallets (Terra Station, XDEFI, Leap), and most importantly the buyback mechanism of $TNS Token.

- Semi real-time Hong Kong Public Traffic Dash
Some data pipeline practice. Calling the Gov OpenData API for weather, traffic and event information, sending back to python dash app to do visualization.
No insights. This is just a typical data pipeline exercise with semi-real-time call on API and processed to dashboard.

- Flipside Crypto, Terra Ecosystem Tracking
Terra is a fast-growing ecosystem on the ride of its decentralized algo-stablecoin - $ust, and it's native chain token $luna. To understand how healthy is the ecosystem expanding, this dashboard hopes to bring some insights on how to quantify metrics to measure is the ecosystem expanding in a healthy way or not.
To quantify the healthiness of Terra Eco, there are three critical aspects to evaluate: 1) Anchor Dominance 2) Bridged Liquidity 3) Burn/mint activity on $ust

- Kedro eComm data Pipeline
As pandemic situation continues, demand of delivery service on food and goods are staying up high, how can customer optimize the bucket items to maximize different discount provided to reach the delivery minimum amount is a critical question to minimize per purchase cost.
Scraping item information like categories, SKU, price, availability, delivery status from HKTV mall, automate pipeline to periodically fetch them into machine learning model, evaluating recommender to best optimize the cost and maximize discount used.
Pretty good to fetch the data into a web-based API then return a best combination of food based on input recipes (like recipe recommendations based on refrigerator items).
